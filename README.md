ðŸŽ® Children's Educational Game
This is an interactive educational game for children, developed in Xcode using Swift, SwiftUI, SpriteKit, and Storyboard.

Gameplay physics are handled by SpriteKit, providing smooth, responsive mechanics.

Custom animations and icons were hand-designed to create an engaging and child-friendly visual experience.

Storyboard was used to implement UI elements such as the introduction screen and navigation flows.

Objective of the game is to drop eggs in timely fashion from the flying chicken, while moving side to side, into a bakset which also moves similarly. 
After each miss the chicken speeds up and so does the basket, increasing in difficulty. Lives remaining are counted and so is the score.

The game is meant to have more features for example being bale to set the diffiuclty to begin with, plus different game modes are also easily implementable.

The idea is to provide childrne with an easy to understand, simple yet fun looking game with short intro/backstory to make it more engaging. With a little more
effort this can be completed as an indutsry level children's game.
